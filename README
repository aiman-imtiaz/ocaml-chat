There are two components in this project, both of which are supposed to be built using dune separately on two different devices.
In order to test the project, open a terminal window and from the root of the repo, type:

```
cd server
dune exec -- ./server.exe -port 225

```

On another terminal window, type the following:

```
cd client
dune exec -- ./client.exe -port 225 -ip 127.0.0.1

```
